I learned to follow the thread of execution.
The most confusing part was reading the built-in method code, especially when nested callback functions are passed are arguments. That and understanding the order of operations. Ex: when the filter method is returning a new array but then there is a small .lenth method attached to the end of it. There are a lot of details to keep track of.
